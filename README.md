 ### Challenges
 One of the biggest challenges was the active storage, and following the trails of errors that kept popping up. Initially the project was running fairly smooth until the seed file was added to the git work flow and that for some reason made everything not work. It took a long period of time identifying the source of the error and that took most of the time. 
 
 ### Learning points
 
 Personally i need to sharpen my concepts so when an error pops up im able to identify the source of the error. Once the error is idenfied usually im able to find a solution either through research of communicating with the team members. Hopefully in the upcoming project im able to play a positive role to make sure the project is a success.
 
 I have a much better grasp on the file structure and how everything is connected. With more practice future projects will run more efficiently.
